9.What is the difference between Server Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG)? When would you prefer SSG over SSR?





Solution:
In server side rendering, the user agent requests a page. Then the sever generates the page’s HTML output and sends it back. The browser renders the HTML page afterwards.
Meanwhile, in static site generation, there’s no need of server.
SSG is preferred over SSR if whenever we lack highly dynamic data that needs to be unique for every user.
